        You can provide a full url to where you have deployed the daas elements
        library. This can be used when it is not possible to use the default cdn
        url hosted by Certua.

      <td>
        This is JSON which contains any custom notification settings required
        for your implementation. By default this property is not required if you
        simply wish to use the default style toastrs.<br />
        Manual Notifications: if this is set to true then toastrs are disabled
        entirely and the host will be required to listen to
        'certua-ob-notifications' channel on the eventbus.
        <br />Use External Toastr Styles: Intended for Internal Certua use, this
        leaves toastrs outside of the shadow dom and the host app has to manage
        ngx-toastr stylesheet
