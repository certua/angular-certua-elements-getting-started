    <h3>Get a site code</h3>
    The site code configure the components telling them what theme, and
    insurance product that they are using. This is a unique code that we will
    provide you with. If you don't have a site code then please contact us at
    <a href="mailto:luke@certua.io">luke@certua.io</a>

        If you would like to see a demo of our components before you get your
        own site code you can use one of our demo site codes. We have two
        different styles of journey, one with multiple questions on one page, or
        one with questions displayed in a sidebar.

    <h3>Using our components</h3>
    <p>
      No matter what coding language your site is written in you can easily
      embed our components with minimal html and javascript. Using our example
      codebase and component explanations embedding one or more of our
      components into your site should be super simple for any developer.
    </p>
    <h4>How our components work together</h4>
    <p>
      We have multiple components that work together to build up the full
      insurance purchasing and servicing experience. You can choose which
      components you wish to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The image shows the components that are available and the order in which
      they are usually used.

    </p>

    <h5>1. Quote and buy</h5>
    <p>
      The main component is the Quote and Buy component. This component is
      responsible for the quoting and purchasing journey. This component can be
      used on its own or in conjunction with the other components. This is the
      usual starting point for your customers.
    </p>
    <h5>2. Login</h5>
    <p>
      This displays a login button based on your authentication status, if you
      are using our security there is nothing more that you need. If you would
      like to link your own security then please speak to us.
    </p>
    <h5>3. View Policy</h5>
    <p>
      This component provides access to any quotes or policies that the customer
      has, as well as viewing the policy details. This will also provide the
      customer with the ability to make Material and Non Material changes to
      their policy.
    </p>
    <h5>4. Log out</h5>
    <p>
      This will show a icon that when clicked on will show a dropdown menu with
      the options to Change Password, View Covers or Logout.
    </p>
    <h5>Claims</h5>
    <p>
      Information about how to make a claim on a policy and can be used by you
      to make this information available to your customers on your web site. It
      is important to make this information easily accessible to your customers
      as it is a regulatory requirement.
    </p>
    <h5>Documents</h5>
    <p>
      This component will provide you with a way to make the policy
      documentation available to your customers on your web site. It is
      important to make this information easily accessible to your customers as
      it is a regulatory requirement.
    </p>
    <h5>First Notification of Loss (FNOL)</h5>
    <p>
      When supported by the insurance product, this displays a form a customer
      can fill in to make a claim. Please check with us if you need to implement
      this component.
    </p>
    <h5>Quick Quote</h5>
    <p>
      This allows you to give out indicative quotes based on a subset of
      questions. This is an optional component that can be used depending on the
      Insurance product being distributed.
