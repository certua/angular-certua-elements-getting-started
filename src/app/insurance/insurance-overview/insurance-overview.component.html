  <h3>Using our components</h3>
  <p>
    No matter what coding language your site is written in you can easily embed
    our components with minimal html and javascript. Using our example codebase
    and component explanations embedding one or more of our components into your
    site should be super simple for any developer.
  </p>
  <h4>How our components work together</h4>
  <p>
    We have multiple components that work together to build up the full
    insurance purchasing and servicing experience. You can choose which
    components you wish to use.
  </p>
  <p>
    The image shows the components that are available and the order in which
    they are usually used.

    />
  </p>

  <h5>1. Quote and buy</h5>
  <p>
    The main component is the Quote and Buy component. This component is
    responsible for the quoting and purchasing journey. This component can be
    used on its own or in conjunction with the other components. This is the
    usual starting point for your customers.
  </p>
  <h5>2. Login</h5>
  <p>
    This displays a login button based on your authentication status, if you are
    using our security there is nothing more that you need. If you would like to
    link your own security then please speak to us.
  </p>
  <h5>3. View Policy</h5>
  <p>
    This component provides access to any quotes or policies that the customer
    has, as well as viewing the policy details. This will also provide the
    customer with the ability to make Material and Non Material changes to their
    policy.
  </p>
  <h5>4. Log out</h5>
  <p>
    This will show a icon that when hovered (or clicked) on will show the
    options to Change Password or Logout. If you are using our security there is
    nothing more that you need. If you would like to link your own security then
    please speak to us.
  </p>
  <h5>Claims</h5>
  <p>
    Information about how to make a claim on a policy and can be used by you to
    make this information available to your customers on your web site. It is
    important to make this information easily accessible to your customers as it
    is a regulatory requirement.
  </p>
  <h5>Documents</h5>
  <p>
    This component will provide you with a way to make the policy documentation
    available to your customers on your web site. It is important to make this
    information easily accessible to your customers as it is a regulatory
    requirement.
  </p>
  <h5>First Notification of Loss (FNOL)</h5>
  <p>
    When supported by the insurance product, this displays a form a customer can
    fill in to make a claim. Please check with us if you need to implement this
    component.
  </p>
  <h5>Quick Quote</h5>
  <p>
    This allows you to give out indicative quotes based on a subset of
    questions. This is an optional component that can be used depending on the
    Insurance product being distributed.
  </p>

  <h4>Legacy components</h4>
  <p>
    We recommend using our newer components but these are available if required
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      View Policy - v1 - This simply displays a single policy based on the
      policy Id
    </li>
    <li>Quotes list - This displays all quotes for a customer</li>
    <li>Policies list - This displays all policies for a customer</li>
